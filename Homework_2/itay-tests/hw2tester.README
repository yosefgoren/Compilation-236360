Log on to CSCOMP, and place hw2tester in a sub-folder of the folder you have your homework compiled. Then, give hw2tester up to 4 arguments:
1: number of tests
2: functions per test
3: max statements per function (don't recommend more than 150, the filesize can reach over 100MB!)
4: allow lots of extra random whitespace (0 for no, any other number for yes)

As of now, this does not test any of the following:
* associativity. this is the biggest issue, and i'm not sure how to test this right now with how i generate the tests.
* comments that contain '\r', '\n', or (char)0xff. I'm pretty sure this tests exactly all legal comments, but do correct me if i'm wrong.
* strings that contain '\r', '\n', '"', '\\' ("alone" or part of an illegal escape sequence), or (char)0xff. Again, pretty sure this tests exactly all legal strings.
* syntax errors or lexical errors. same as associativity, seems like a real headache to implement.

In case you got this zip, you don't know where it came from, and want to report a problem, contact me at itaybe@campus.technion.ac.il
